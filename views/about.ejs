Now About Blogging, The term 'weblog' was coined by Jorn Barger on 17 December 1997.<br> The short form, 'blog', was coined by Peter Merholz, who jokingly broke the word weblog into the phrase we blog in the sidebar of his blog Peterme.com in April or May 1999.It's generally recognized that the first blog was Links.net, created by Justin Hall, while he was a Swarthmore College student in 1994. Of course, at that time they weren't called blogs, and he just referred to it as his personal homepage.<br> It wasn't until 1997 that the term 'weblog' was coined.The purpose of a blog is to create a more engaging website for your brand. Along with using your website to teach users about your products and services, you can also include a blog section to teach consumers about topics that are relevant to your field.<br>  People Of Any Skill Level Can Create a Blog. One reason why blogging is so popular is that it is surprisingly easy. Although in the past you had to be somewhat skilled at web design in order to create an online presence, blogging makes this easier than ever before. In-depth topic blogs were also becoming more popular during this time. They often delved much deeper into current news and pop culture than mainstream media sources, in addition to commenting directly on what traditional media was reporting.By 2001, there was enough interest in blogging that some how-to articles and guides started cropping up. Now, “meta blogs” (blogs about blogging) make up a sizable portion of the most popular and successful blogs out there.<br>A number of mainstream media sites started their own blogs during the mid to late 2000s, or teamed up with existing blogs to provide additional coverage and commentary. By 2004, political consultants, candidates, and mainstream news organizations all began using blogs more prominently. They provided the perfect vehicle for broadcasting editorial opinion and reaching out to readers and viewers. </p>
